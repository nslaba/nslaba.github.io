    <div class="exhibitions-intro">
      <p>When I first started showing my work, I had no real sense of what I wanted from it. The impulse to make art has always been about expression — trying to communicate something I can't quite grasp with words yet, and wanting that idea to be seen, to connect with the world around me.</p>
      <p>Early on I thought exhibiting was about putting yourself out there, standing alone in a spotlight. With time I realized it was less about me and more about the pure act of bringing people into the same room. Getting them to look, to talk, to be present together. Connection is the primary intention behind my art making — and the exhibitions became the clearest expression of that.</p>
