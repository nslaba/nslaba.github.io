            <h2>Task</h2>
            <p>Create an animation with full creative freedom fulfilling the particular requirements defined under "criteria".</p>
            <h2>Technical Criteria</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>At least one: two hierarchical object</li>
                <li>Containing at least two textures either procedural or mapped</li>
                <li>At least one shader edited or designed from scratch</li>
                <li>360 Degree camera fly around</li>
                <li>Connection to real-time</li>
                <li>Display the frame rate in the console every 2 seconds</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>I have decided to play around with color and scale to create a fantastical animation with a humorous twist.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I have created a psychedelic background within the cone by mapping my own paintings as a texture to the mountains.</li>
                <li>I have used the shader to simulate a sun rising and setting. I have done this by synchronizing the darkness/lightness of the switching colors on the inside of the cone with the rising and setting of a multicolored sphere representing the sun.</li>
                <li>I have scaled gravity over time.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>**** All image textures used are my own paintings</p>
