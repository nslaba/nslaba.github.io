WHAT I HAVE DONE (SYNOPSIS) :
            main.html - modified the fragment shader to be switched with a uniform. 
            main.js   - The story consists of a big human looking inside of a "magical" cone. Everything outside
                        of the cone as well as its outer surface is black and white. Once the camera rotates and
                        zooms in onto the inside of the cone, then we are presented with a view at the "magical" 
                        world within with the big human's eye in the background. 
                        Within the cone are two characters. One of them is learning how to fly while the other one
                        is sitting, watching the first character and waving. The first character eventurally succeeds
                        and drifts off in flight. However he comes back a few moments after shooting through the scene
                        without control. He does that one more time while hitting the big human in the eye. The scene
                        ends by zooming out, while the "magical" cone falls and the big human grows a black eye.

* Note on textures - both textures I have used are my own paintings

[4 Marks] DONE -At least one two-level hierarchical object (e.g. human arm).
[6 Marks] DONE -Make use of at least two textures either procedural or mapped. You must map them to a(n) object(s) in a meaningful way. Using the textures from the Lab modified assignment base code does not count toward the two. --> DONE (just gotta make nicer objects lol)
[5 Marks] DONE -Convert the ADS shader in the assignment base code from a vertex shader to a fragment shader. --> DONE
[2 Marks] DONE -Convert the Phong to Blinn-Phong in the new assignment base code fragment shader created in step 3. --> DONE
[5 Marks] DONE -At least one shader edited or designed from scratch to perform a clearly visible effect. Each line of your shader code must be commented clearly explaining exactly what the following line does and why. You must clearly identify the purpose and effect the shader produces in the submitted README.
[4 Marks] DONE -360 degrees camera fly around using lookAt() and setMV(). --> DONE
[4 Marks] DONE -Connection to real-time. You should make sure that your scene runs in real-time on fast enough machines. Real-time means that one simulated second corresponds roughly to one real second. --> DONE
[2 Marks] DONE (IN THE CONSOLE) - You should display the frame rate of your program in the console window or the graphics window once every 2 seconds.
[5 Marks] DONE TO MY BEST ABILITY - Complexity: scene setup and design, movement of animated elements, and programming.
[5 Marks] DONE TO MY BEST ABILITY - Creativity: storytelling, scene design, object appearance and other artistic elements.
[5 Marks] DONE TO MY BEST ABILITY - Quality:  Attention to detail, modelling quality, rendering quality, motion control.
[2 Marks] DONE TO MY BEST ABILITY - Programming style.
[-2 Marks if not] Make and submit a movie of your animation. The movie should be at least 512x512 resolution and in a standard format, such as mp4. Include a cover image (png or jpg) of at least 512x512 pixels. You may use any screen capture program that is available (e.g. ShareX).
[-4 Marks if not] Provide a readme.txt that describes what you have done, what you have omitted, and any other information that will help the grader evaluate your work, including what is stated below.
